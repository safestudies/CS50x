# CS50x
My CS50 Studies;
Here I will be learning code and posting it so i can keep track of my development
starting the week 1 of the course 28-10-23;

I've caught myself spending a lot of hours doing the problem sets and labs of both first weeks, so I'm gonna start to do only 2 of the optional exercises in the problem sets instead of doing all of them, so i can finish the course and move on to compTiaA+ before start of 2024.
starting week 3 on 13/11/23
